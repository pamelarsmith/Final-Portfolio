      <p>There are two effective strategies to transform a yard or lawn into a food producing garden space. Individuals can plant directly into the ground or construct raised garden beds. It is cheaper and less initial work to plant into the ground while raised beds provide more control of soil quality and less bending over. </p>

  <p>With either method the position within the lawn is critical to plant growth. A patch that receives at least 6 hours of sunlight per day is optimal. The ground should be as flat as possible and well drained to prevent flooding. Decent air flow will improve the health of vegetation and a close-by water source will simplify the caretaking process. Decide how large of an area is necessary for the garden by multiplying the number of each plant desired by the square footage it occupies at maturity. Keep the width of the garden small enough that all plants can be reached without stepping inside the planting area.  </p>

<h2>In-ground Method</h2>

          <ul>
            <li>Use a shovel to remove the sod from the designated garden space. Dispose of this sod or turn it upside down in the hole to ensure the grass rots away.</li>
            <li>Spread a 3 inch layer of top soil. Do not excessively compact this dirt as it will impede root growth and water circulation.</li>
          </ul>

<h2>Raised Bed Method</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Use a shovel to remove the sod from the designated garden space. Dispose of this sod or turn it upside down in the hole to ensure the grass rots away.</li>
  <li>Roll a layer of black landscaping fabric on the ground over the garden space.</li>
  <li>Drive wooden stakes into the ground in each corner of the garden area.</li>
  <li>Attach boards of at least 12 inches in height to the stakes using screws and a drill. This forms a box that is the frame of the raised bed.</li>
  <li>Fill the frame to the brim with top soil. Do not excessively compact this dirt as it will impede root growth and water circulation.</li>
</ul>
