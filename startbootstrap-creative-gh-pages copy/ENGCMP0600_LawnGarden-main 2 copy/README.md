# Lawn to Garden Project Information
#### _Project History_
The Lawn to Garden Project is a class project for ENGCMP 0600 Intro to Technical Writing at the University of Pittsburgh, taught by Stephen Quigley. Jared Garthwait, Elijah Hyndman, Paul Kirby, Evan Rafferty, and Pamela Smith contributed to this project.

The website files can be found at: https://elijahhyndman.github.io/ENGCMP0600_LawnGarden/
Original Version 1.0 as of 3/25/22.

The purpose of this project is to provide access to information on how to build and maintain a home garden in a suburban setting. Information in the initial version of this project is divided by the two major urban areas in the state of Pennsylvania – Pittsburgh and Philadelphia. Subsections of the website provide further information on local laws, gardening ethics, crop recommendations and maintenence, and gardening inclusion.

#### _Website Instructions_
From our home page, users can navigate to other pages of information about how to build and maintain a home garden.

Select a city from the map of Pennsylvania to read geographically relevant information on gardening laws and zones for that city.

Scroll past the map on the home page to access four other buttons. These buttons will take you to pages on broader gardening topics. The functions of these buttons are listed below.
- 'Conversion Process': Contains information on how to convert a common yard or lawn into a food garden. Instructions for how to build an in-ground or raised garden bed are included.
- 'Plant Care': Contains information on how to tend to food-producing crops in a home setting.
- 'Ethics': Contains information on pesticides and mindful gardening practices.
- 'Inclusion': Contains information on how to maintain crops in limited spaces, such as an apartment. Also contains information on low cost gardening options.

All of these pages have a bar of buttons at the top. Use these buttons to navigate to other pages, as well as the main home page.
