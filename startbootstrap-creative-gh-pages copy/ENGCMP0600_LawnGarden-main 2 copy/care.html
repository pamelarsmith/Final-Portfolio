          <h2>Tending to Your Garden</h2>
      <p>A healthy garden is a fruitful one. Here are some care tips to ensure your garden is the best it can be. </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Prepare the soil.</li>
            <ul><p>Prepare your soil by fertilizing, adding compost, and adjusting soil pH. Fertilizer and compost add nutrients, and a good pH lets plants absorb them better.  Plants rely on the nutrients in soil to grow, so it is important your soil is high quality.</p></ul>
            <li>Apply mulch.</li>
            <ul><p>Mulch is a gardenerâ€™s best friend! When planting, you should add about 2 inches of mulch. It cools soil, deters weeds, retains water, and serves as compost. There are several different types of mulch, including shredded wood, straw, and even synthetic materials. The best type of mulch to use depends on your specific plants, but they all have similar benefits. </p></ul>
            <li>Water regularly.</li>
            <ul><p>Water your garden with 1-2 inches of water every week, depending on the weather (hotter weather and more sun necessitate more water). Water ensures that your plants stay hydrated, and hydrated plants have a better output. Look out for brown, dry leaves and wilting. These can be signs that your garden needs watering. On the other hand, be careful not to overwater - look out for yellow, limp leaves.</p></ul>
            <li>Trim stragglers.</li>
            <ul><p>If parts of your plants look dead or diseased, prune them with a pair of trimmers. Look out for browning, strange spots or mold, and powdery, odd textured leaves - these are all potential signs of disease. Trimming allows the healthy part to grow better, as it prevents the spread of disease and lets the plant concentrate its nutrients in the healthy areas.</p></ul>
            <li>Watch for weeds.</li>
            <ul><p>If you see a weed, be sure to remove it before it gets out of control. Pull them out by the roots so they do not grow back. Weeds compete with your vegetables for nutrients, causing them to grow poorly. Some common weeds to look out for are crabgrass, wood sorrels (a ground covering resembling clover), and ground ivy.  </p></ul>
          </ul>
