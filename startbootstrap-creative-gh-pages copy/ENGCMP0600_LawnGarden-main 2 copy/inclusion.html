          <h2>LOW-COST OPTIONS:</h2>
          <p>While starting a lawn garden is a great source of low-cost food right at your doorstep, it can be an expensive upfront investment to start growing plants successfully. Instead of building big gardens, other objects can be used as planters. Recycled materials such as bathtubs, plastic bins, and wooden pallets can be reconfigured into successful plots. Other techniques such as vertical planting can save on space and do not require excessive materials to begin growing. Plant selection can also be important for both upfront and long-term costs. Species that thrive year-round will be more efficient than plants that depend on certain seasons. Hardy plants will be able to adapt to different kinds of available soil and will be able to survive any potential mismanagement. Focusing on cheap and durable plants will allow anyone to have a successful garden that does not break the bank.</p>
          <p>Another important idea for gardening that can both assist with cost and success is community involvement. Going to local events such as seed swaps can be great ways to get otherwise inaccessible seeds for very cheap, and interacting with other gardeners in your area can be beneficial for discussing the best practices for the area. Asking others for spare supplies such as soil, fertilizer, or tools is also an easy way to cut down costs. Online marketplaces such as Facebook Marketplace and Craigslist also offer many free supplies just for the price of taking it off of their hands. With enough scouring, frugal farming is completely possible.</p>
          <h2>APARTMENT GARDENING:</h2>
          <p>For those who do not have direct access to lawns or open grass spaces, such as residents of apartment buildings, many alternatives to lawn gardening exist that still allow for fresh fruits, vegetables, and herbs to be grown from the comfort of oneâ€™s own home. With enough time, care, and sunlight, planting anywhere is possible. Indoor gardening follows many of the same strategies of winter gardening, which, while difficult, can still produce successful plants. Certain benefits for gardening indoors include easier temperature and water regulation, and better protection from the elements. However, with a smaller space to grow, there is a smaller yield from each crop - and a smaller selection of plants that can be grown indoors to begin with. Some of the best plants that better adapt to mixed sunlight and the indoor environment include leafy greens such as carrots, lettuce, peppers, and tomatoes, as well as many different types of herbs including mint and thyme. </p>
          <p>The most prominent form of indoor gardening is utilizing large pots and locating the best angle for sunlight to reach the plant for as much of the day as possible. Sunlight can also be substituted for specialized grow lights, which can be found at many home improvement stores. In terms of soil, indoor gardens grow best in a potting mix composed of many different elements. The other crucial part of indoor gardening is watering, which will need to be carefully measured depending on each plant included in the garden.</p>
          <h2>COMMUNITY GARDENS:</h2>
          <p>Another resource for anyone looking to get started with gardening but lacks space for growing is community gardens. Plots set aside for people to rent out and grow their own plants are extremely common in large metro areas and allow anyone to get started without having to build their own. Resources for community gardens in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia can be found below:</p>
