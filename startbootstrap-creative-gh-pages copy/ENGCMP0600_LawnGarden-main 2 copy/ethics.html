          <h2>Mind your neighbors: insects, community, and keeping an ethical garden</h2>

          <ul>
            What’s your first instinct when seeing a pesky bug – to squash it? To move it? To run in circles screaming? What about grabbing a bottle of chemicals?
Pesticides are a very common method of vanquishing insects harmful to plant growth and production, and sustain a massive global agricultural market. But what chemicals can you use in your own backyard? Is there such a thing as too much? Should you use any at all? These are important questions to answer before even purchasing seeds.

</br>

Before getting into the details of pesticides, consider non chemical-based alternatives to combating pests that can reduce your need for pesticides. Properly feeding, watering, draining, and rotating your crops can keep them strong and healthy. Choose plants that are suitable for your area’s weather conditions, or are naturally resistant to disease and pests. Physical barriers such as mesh or mats can help reduce the amount of pests that get to your plants. Natural predators, such as ladybugs, can also help target pests without harming other creatures.

</br>

In addition to killing harmful insects, certain pesticides can also cause harm to helpful insects, such as bees. Insects can also build resistance to certain pesticides, rendering them less effective in the long run. And lastly, using any pesticide at all on food crops runs the risk of residual pesticides finding their way onto your plate.
But there are “less toxic” pesticide options, should the need for them arise. These “less toxic” options still deal damage to harmful insects, but cause less harm to the environment, and can break down quickly, thus reducing risk for humans and other animals as well. Rapid breakdown, however, means that more frequent application is required.

</br>
Sometimes, the threat to your garden isn’t the hungry bugs or the scary chemicals – sometimes, it’s the plants themselves. Invasive species of plants can overrun your garden, as well as your neighbor’s. When seeds spread by birds or other animals, this damage can be widespread, and very harmful. How do you control this botanical devastation? Go native. Be mindful of what plants you allow into your garden – prioritize native species, and remove all invasive ones immediately.
Your garden doesn’t have to have a negative impact on your community. Responsible gardening that takes environmental health into consideration is good gardening! To further benefit your community, consider donating excess produce to your local food bank, so others can enjoy fresh and healthy food options. Happy planting!
